# 🏋️‍♂️ FitFlow — Architecture, HLD, LLD & Folder Structure

**Tagline:** Plan your workouts. Execute with discipline. Track your progress. Stay consistent.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### **Frontend (Client / Presentation Layer)**

* React + Vite
* TailwindCSS / Material UI
* Axios (REST API calls)

* Optional: Service Workers / Notifications

### **Backend (Server / Application Layer)**

* Node.js + Express.js
* MongoDB (Database)
* JWT (Authentication)
* Business Logic Layer (Workout Execution State Management)

**Microservices:**

> Single backend service (monolithic architecture) — clean & scalable
> Frontend is a client application
